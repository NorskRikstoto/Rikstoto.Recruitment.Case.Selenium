# Case
We want to make smoke tests to verify that http://beta.rikstoto.no works as expected in production.

You are the test developer in the project. 

We have decided to use Selenium in Python to implement the smoke tests, and we are starting with the front page.

We have done some analysis and found that we need 3 tests to verify. 1 is implemented, and you need to implement the other 2.

Implement the missing tests to [frontpage_tests.py](tests/frontpage_tests.py)

Your are free to refactor/restructure the code as you see fit.

## Time Restrictions
The the solution shall be delivered within Friday November 2nd at 11:00.

The solution is submitted by sending the file frontpage_tests.py to roger.hoem-martinsen@rikstoto.no

There are no time restrictions to this case, other than the deadline.

# What are we looking for?

* Clear understanding on how to use Selenium and Python
